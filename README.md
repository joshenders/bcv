# BCV: Open-source tools for tracking healthcare workers' locations during the COVID-19 pandemic

_Busca y Captura para el Virus (Search and arrest the virus): A tool for GPS tracking of healthcare workers so as to empower and automate epidemiological contact-tracing_

## What is BCV?

BCV stands for "busca y captura el virus" (search and arrest the virus). It's a framework / suite of open-source tools for tracking the locations of healthcare workers (HCWs) so as to enable automated contact-tracing when a HCW tests positive.

## Who is BCV for?

Public health agencies, hospitals, ministries, etc. Anyone managing workers who are at high-risk of infection.

## Why track HCWs?

HCWs are at high risk for getting infected, and therefore at high risk for infecting their community. Because of their movement between (a) epicenters of contagion (hospitals, etc.) and (b) the community, they present a special risk to the community at large (even in a context of lock-down / confinement / shelter-in-place).

## How does this work?

If you want to set up the location-tracking system, you either need to:

- Get your IT team to follow [this guide](docs/it_guide.md) to deploy your own system
- Request Databrew to deploy a system for you by [EMAILING US](info@databrew.cc)
